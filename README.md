1. **Arrays**

2. **Stacks**


3. **Queues**


4. **LinkedList** - A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

    - **Singly Linked List** - A linear data structure, where each element is connected to the next one by a pointer.

        A node of Singly Linked List looks like below:
            
        `[ data | next node ]`

    - **Doubly Linked List** - Linked List where each element points to the next one, and the next element points to the previous one. The "previous" of head points to null and the so does the "next" of the last node.

        A node of Singly Linked List looks like below:
            
        `[ previous node | data | next node ]`

    - **Circular Linked List** - very similar to Singly Linked List, however the last node instead of null, points to the head.
